# Movie_Recommender-System 🎥☑️😃
In this project, I will develop a collaborative filtering-based recommender system using Python and the Surprise library. My goal is to leverage the latest MovieLens dataset, which contains user ratings for movies, to create an effective recommendation engine. I will preprocess the dataset by converting it into a utility matrix and splitting it into training and testing sets. Using the training data, I will implement both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithms. The performance of these algorithms will be evaluated by calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE) on the testing set. Additionally, I will explore the possibility of improving the recommender system by implementing a hybrid approach that combines user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques. My findings and recommendations for enhancing the system will be summarized and presented in the Python notebook. Through this project, I aim to build an accurate and efficient recommender system that can provide valuable movie recommendations to users.
